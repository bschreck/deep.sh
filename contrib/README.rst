Contributions, or contribs, are a set of tools and conventions for extending
the functionality of deepsh beyond what is provided by default. This allows
3rd party developers and users to improve their deepsh experience without
having to go through the deepsh development and release cycle.

This contrib directory represents an implicit namespace package.
DO NOT add an __init__.py file to this directory.
