Originally posted in https://github.com/deepsh/deepsh/issues/2726#issuecomment-406447196 :
    Recently @CJ-Wright has started up a ``deepsh.lib`` (``deepsh.api``) sub-package, which is usable from pure Python.
    This is meant as a standard library for deepsh and downstream tools.
    Currently there are some deepsh-ish wrappers around ``os`` and ``subprocess``.
    We'd love to see more contributions to this effort! So if there is something
    like ``sh()`` that you'd like to see, by all means please help us add it!
