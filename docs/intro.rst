Deepsh is a Python-powered, cross-platform, Unix-gazing shell language and
command prompt. The language is a superset of Python 3.6+ with additional
shell primitives that you are used to from Bash and IPython. It works on
all major systems including Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. Deepsh is meant
for the daily use of experts and novices alike.
